# Machine Learning Models
First Machine Learning Coursework with Adam Pluck for which I received a grade of 85%. The final report and code (.ipynb) is included. My main contributions to the report are the sections focusing on:
- conjugate priors
- Gaussian processes
- graphical models
- non-parametric vs parametric models
- effects of the lengthscale parameter
- Relationship between assumptions, beliefs and preferences. Both philosophically and from a machine learning perspective
- Model complexity, model flexibility and the pitfalls of parameter counting
